Idea: build a multi language system that can run a tetris game on a web page.

system language: C++ for game logic

scripting language: Python( other info needs display on the web like score, game time, rounds), 
                    JavaScript( display the game ui and all other info)

Inter-language communication method: SWIG(use for between C++ and python) and GraalVM(passing data from python to javascript and vise versa)

Deployment technology: Vagrant VM
